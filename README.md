## Overview

Heureka is a Security Posture Management tool designed to manage security issues in a complex technology landscape.

Huereka aims to empower service owners with a central platform for proactive security management by integrating key components such as advanced patch management, intelligent SIEM analysis, and automated policy enforcement.

It is also designed to address the critical compliance aspect as it is equipped with capabilities to track the end-to-end remediation processes, thereby providing tangible compliance evidence. This approach to security posture management ensures a comprehensive and professional approach to maintaining robust security standards.
