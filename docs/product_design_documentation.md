# Product Design Document - Heureka 

## Vision

**Heureka is a Security Posture Management tool designed to manage the security issues in a complex technology landscape.**

Heureka is committed to empowering service owners with a central platform for proactive security management. It seamlessly integrates key components such as advanced patch management, intelligent SIEM analysis, and automated policy enforcement.

It is also designed to address the critical compliance aspect as it is equipped with capabilities to track the end-to-end remediation process, thereby providing tangible compliance evidence. This approach to security posture management ensures a comprehensive and professional approach to maintaining robust security standards.

## Problem Statements

### Complexity and Visibility
Maintaining security in a complex cloud operations platform landscape is a monumental task. These landscapes often consist of numerous services, each with a multitude of components like images, databases, libraries, and configurations. 
The challenge is compounded by the fact that these components have varying versions and can be shared across multiple services creating a critical need to pinpoint the specific instance (version) of a component as the security baseline, as vulnerabilities within a single component can impact multiple services within the landscape.

### Compliance and Efficiency
Meeting compliance requirements and maintaining robust security standards is time-consuming and resource-intensive due to the lack of centralized visibility into the intricate relationships and dependencies between services and their underlying components as well as configurations.
This makes tracking remediation, documenting evidence, and managing security configurations difficult leading to inefficient security operations and delayed remediation efforts.
 
## Business Goals 
 
- Enhance Visibility and Security Posture:
  - Track the overall state of the technology landscape 
  - Track security issues associated to specific components of the technology landscape
 
- Streamline Security Operations:
  - Provide a central platform to monitor and assess the overall security posture of the technology landscape
  - Streamline the patch management process to close vulnerabilities and reduce attack surfaces.
  - Enforce consistent security configurations across all systems to minimize misconfigurations that could create security gaps.
  - Improve threat detection and response with Security Incident and Event Management (SIEM) Integration to aid threat detection and incident response.

- Enhance Compliance, and Auditability:
  - Assists in meeting security compliance requirements by tracking remediation status/progress and providing evidence of adherence.
  - Document the remediation, classification, and impact of issues 
  - Document the changes corresponding with Patching of Vulnerabilities, Updating components, threat detection alert remediations, and configuration updates.

## Terms

| Term | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Support Group | A support group consists of multiple users working on a defined scope of services |
| Support Group Owner | Owners/ administrators of Support Group |
| Support Group Engineer | Individual users that are members of a support group |
| Service | Services are the main entities used by Heureka to represent our in. A service consists of one or multiple components. With an owner and at least one delegate |
| Component | A service consists of one or more components and is the basis for confirming a service is affected by an issue. There are different component types such as (Keppel)Image of Github Repository. |
| Component Instance | A component that is an instance of a component |
| Component Version | A version of a specific component at a certain point in time |
| Package | Packages are a technical detail for Keppel Images. Keppel uses Clair as a vulnerability scanner and performs package indexing. This package list gives information about what is used in the Keppel Image. |
| Issue | An issue is the absolute base unit of a weakness which could be a vulnerability, security event, or policy violation |
| Issue Match | This is the association of a found weakness to the deficient resource (component instance). It therefore represents the issue to be fixed|
| Service Owner | A service owner is the responsible person for a service. They represent the service in an audit and are responsible for the fulfillment of security controls |
| Delegate | A person that is a delegate for the Service Owner |
| Activity | The collects all remediation-related information and related changes for each issue match|
| Change | A change captures a change event in a specific component |
| Evidence | Evidence consists of all audit-relevant information. |
| Target Remediation Timeline | Target Remediation Timeline - the timeline in which a specific issue match has to get remediated |
| Remediation | A change that eliminates an issue match |
| Irrelevance Statement | A reasoned statement that a specific "Issue Match" is irrelevant for a component or set of components |
| Rollback | The rollback of a change for a component(s)/issue(s) combination |
| Process Facilitator | The person responsible for ensuring that all established processes are followed including the patch management process and the Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) process |
